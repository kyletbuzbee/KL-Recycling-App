WHY THESE ICONS MATTER FOR YOUR BUSINESS:
─────────────────────────────────────────

1. VISUAL MATERIAL RECOGNITION
   Your AI weight estimation is a competitive advantage. Icons should clearly
   represent the materials you accept to build user confidence.

2. PROFESSIONAL INDUSTRIAL APPEARANCE
   Scrap metal recycling is industrial work. Icons should look trustworthy,
   heavy-duty, and technically competent - not cute or cartoonish.

3. MOBILE FIRST OPTIMIZATION
   Small screens mean icons need to be immediately recognizable at 32x32px.
   Clean, minimal designs work better than complex illustrations.

4. BRAND CONSISTENCY
   Royal blue theme throughout reinforces your brand identity across the app.

ICON CREATION WORKFLOW RECOMMENDATION:
───────────────────────────────────────

1. Start with navigation icons (highest user interaction)
2. Create material type icons (core business functionality)
3. Add service icons (your revenue-generating features)
4. Finish with advanced organizational icons

AI GENERATION PROMPT STRATEGY:
• Reference specific equipment (e.g., "roll-off dumpster on wheels")
• Include real brand colors (#0B3D91, #3B82F6)
• Mention industrial/commercial context
• Specify "mobile app icon" for appropriate styling
• Include "transparent background, clean vector style"

DELIVERABLES: 512px PNG files for professional app experience.
